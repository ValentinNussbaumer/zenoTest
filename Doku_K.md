# Controll

## How did we controll
We controlled our websites with different testing cases and our exceptions of the tests. We wrote our testings in a testing protocol to have everything writen down. The controlling part was important for us because we want to have a good website for our user. On the whole, the website had few bugs to fix, but they were not very big. We are happy with the result of the testing and only had to make a few adjustments.
