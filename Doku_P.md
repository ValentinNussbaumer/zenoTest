# Planning
We did our planning with different to-do lists of the topics. The to-do lists help to organize the work you want to finish on that day. A schedule helps us to stay in time and to focus on the work we have to do on the day. The schedule is planned so that we have enough time for each individual step. To not work on the same things we split our work and wrote down what the goals are.
