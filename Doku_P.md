# Planning

## How we did our planning
For the start we needed a tasklist to know who will do what in the project. After we decided what our project would be we wrote our tasklist with the tasks we need to do to finish the project. We planned the whole project work With a big workplan. We needed to do this to have a plan until when we have to finish the tasks.

## Work plan
We wrote the work plan in Google tables with the help of the already existing tables in Github. In the work plan are the tasks we need to finish by the different dates. A good work plan helps to stay on time and to focus on the work we have to do on the day. The work plan is planned so that we have enough time for each individual step. To not work on the same things we split our work and wrote down what the goals are.

## Task list 
We wrote the task list also in google tables with the help of the example in Github. We wrote one simple tasklist with the big things we need to do and one tasklist which is smaller for the subtasks.
