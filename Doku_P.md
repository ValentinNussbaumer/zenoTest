# Planning

## How we did our planning
For the start we needed a tasklist to know who will do what in the project. After we decided what our project will be we wrote our tasklist with the tasks we need to do to finish the project. We planned the whole project work With a big workplan. We needed to do this to have a plan until when we have to finish the tasks.

## Workplan
We wrote the schedule in Google tables with the help of the already existing tables in the Github. In the Schedule are the tasks we need to finish by the different dates. A good workplan helps to stay in time and to focus on the work we have to do on the day. The worklplan is planned that we have enough time for each individual step. To not work on the same things we split our work and wrote down what the goals are.

## Task list list
We wrote the task list also in google tables with the help of the example in Github. We wrote one simple tasklist with the big things we need to do and one tasklist whitch is smaller for the subtasks.
