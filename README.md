## Who are we?
Our names are Ilija and Valentin and we are both 15 years old. We are doing our apprenticeship at Google and wanted to do our project together. 

## Project Description
We wanted to do a useful project that can also be used by other students. We came up with the idea to program a website where students can chat together about the school or other things. You can create rooms and chat with your friends in a private chat room.
