Modul 431
Introduction
Our goal is to create a forum where students can chat and exchange together about school, exams, modules and their apprenticeship. You can use our software also for other things but the core idea would be to write about the listed topics. Our goal is to practice the work with IPERKA and to know how to use it on further projects. We have 20 lessons to finish, to have enough time for other things and a little buffer. 
	

Inform
For informing we started with a brainstorming and exchanging our ideas. After a long exchange we decided to do our idea with the forum. We are getting the most coding skills from w3schools and Youtube. Information about the data of the users are researched on different websites. The Gitlab is also helping us to go on in the project. We have many different documents for the individual topics where we express our thoughts.

Plan
We did our planning with different to-do lists of the topics. The to-do lists help to organize the work you want to finish on that day. A schedule helps us to stay in time and to focus on the work we have to do on the day. The schedule is planned so that we have enough time for each individual step. To not work on the same things we split our work and wrote down what the goals are.

Decide
After a short discussion about splitting the work we have decided .Valentin who does most of the coding will do the biggest part in the coding process. Ilija will show him sketches how the chat forum could look like.

Realisation
In our project we have to code, plan and to exchange. The biggest part of the coding will do Valentin because of his experience in coding. The testing and debugging part will be done by Ilija. The good thing is that we will both have a impact on the project and can change things together.
