# Inform

## how did we come to this topic?
For informing we started with a brainstorming and exchanging our ideas. After a long exchange we decided to do our idea with the chating website. We are getting the most coding skills from w3schools and Youtube. Information about the data of the users are researched on different websites. The Gitlab is also helping us to go on in the project. We have many different documents for the individual topics where we express our thoughts.
