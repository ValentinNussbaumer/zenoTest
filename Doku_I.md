## How did we come to this topic?
We wanted to do a project where coding is important and where we can learn from each other. We wanted to do something that is useful for other apprentices and that it can be used in everyday life. It should be realistic with the time and the knowledge we have and it should be fun. We started with a brainstorming and exchanging our ideas. We discussed possible ideas for our project and what would fit us. After a long exchange we decided to do a chatting website for apprentices.










We are getting the most coding skills from w3schools and Youtube. Information about the data of the users are researched on different websites. The Gitlab is also helping us to go on in the project. We have many different documents for the individual topics where we express our thoughts.
