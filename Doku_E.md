# Decisions

## How did we decide
Before writing the decisions in a decision matrix we discussed what our strengths are and what we will do. After discussing it we decided that Valentin will do more programming and Ilija will write more documentation. 






 Ilija will show him sketches of how the website could look like. He will also help debugging and testing what Valentin coded. Ilija will write the documentation and exchange with Valentin the work he does to know what to write in the documentation. The goal is that we can exchange easily and to know what the other is working on.
