# Assess
We divided up our work from the beginning and were able to start working early. We divided the work according to our strengths and the knowledge we have.
We often discussed where we were and what we still had to work on. The good thing was that we could give each other feedback and help each other. Without that, our project would probably only have been half as good as it is now.
We were mostly on schedule and our work plan worked out well. We could take a lot of experience for next projects and are now more confident in using IPERKA.
