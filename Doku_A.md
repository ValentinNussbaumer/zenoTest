# Assess
We divided up our work from the beginning and were able to start working early. We divided the work according to our strengths and the knowledge we have.
We often discussed where we were and what we still had to work on. The good thing was that we could give each other feedback and help each other. Without that, our project would probably only have been half as good as it is now.
We were mostly on schedule and our work plan worked out well. We could take a lot of experience for next projects and are now more confident in using IPERKA.

## Joint conclusion/review:
We are both very pleased with the result and are happy that it is as we imagined it. It was important to us that we do everything we set out to do and that we follow our plans. In the end we were able to do everything important until the delivery and had a good project at the end. We also discussed a lot with Mr. Devlin and talked with him about our project. He helped us to find gaps in our project and fix them independently afterwards. Looking back, we would both do it again and are happy that we have implemented this idea.

### ilija's conclusion
I think that Valentin and I worked very well together. We helped each other with problems and were able to solve problems together. In a project, that's also important because otherwise it's not really teamwork. In addition, we worked persistently and didn't let ourselves get distracted. But we were aware of our tasks and knew exactly who had to do what. So we both didn't work on the same thing and had our areas.

### valentin's conclusion
This project was a lot of fun for me. Especially the programming was a lot of fun. I am surprised what a good result we could achieve. At the beginning I had some doubts whether we would be able to meet the basic requirements, but we were able to exceed them. I was able to implement many more features that made the product much better. The website remained efficient and accessible at the same time. Even if there were still some small bugs, I was able to solve a lot of them. The documentation is very detailed and we were able to write something useful for all areas of the documentation. I'm looking forward to keep working on this Project in the feuture and improve my skills even more in this area. And to use the skills I have learned successfully in other projects.
